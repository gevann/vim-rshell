INTRODUCTION                                    *rshell*

This plugin provides a function for use in your `.vimrc` file, named Rshell.
Rshell takes two parameters, a name and a command. It then creates a set of
E, S, and V versions of the command given where E is for the current buffer,
S is in a new split, and V is in a new vertical split.
e.g.

`call Rshell('curl', 'curl -s <args>')` would create three functions:
 - Ecurl
 - Scurl
 - Vcurl
These could be used as `:Scurl 'string-to-pass-to-curl'`, and would then dump
the output into a new split buffer.
In order to use the command in your vimrc file you must source the plugin first,
because normally plugins are sourced after vimrc and you will get error messages
about the RShell function not being defined. To do this call `runtime plugin/rshell.vim`
before you call RShell the first time.

*RShell*
RShell          Given parameters *name*, and *cmd*, creates three versions
                of a function that calls out to *cmd*, named E<name>, S<name>,
                and V<name>. The E version will output the results of command
                into the current buffer, the S version into a new split, and
                the V version into a new vertical split.
